# Welcome to Haneen's Portfolio!

This is my website porfolio for assignment 2. In this project we've been asked to build our porfolio with 4 main pages (home, about me, projects, and contact me) using **EJS**, **Bootstrap** and **NodeJS/ExpressJS**.
The gives the sit a clean and responsive structure. This site is also deployed using **Render**.

## Overview
The website is fully responsive using Bootstrap and my own CSS file (app.css) and is designed for a clean and easy experience.  
It includes partials for headers, navigation, and footers, and many other useful features.

## Technologies Used
- **EJS** (templating engine)  
- **Bootstrap** (responsive front-end framework)  
- **Node.js / Express** (server-side setup)  
- **Render** (cloud hosting provider)

## Deployment
The website is deployed using **Render**, allowing for easy updates and continuous cloud hosting.

## Works Cited

Most of this assignment was taken straight from course content (like navigation bars, partials folder, and so on) as well as from examplar bootstrap code. Below are code segments taken from bootstrap.

1. Bootstrap grid system: this was skeletal code I used in order to create rows/columns for several aspects of my site. For example it was used to structure my about me page (with the row of icons), my projects page (the rows of project text boxes), and any other structure following a row/column format. The skeletal code from Bootstrap can be accessed here: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/grid/
2. Bootstrap navbar: this was used in an in-class example but I will include it anyways. Both the header and footer navbar follow this code structure from Bootstrap: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/navbar/
3. Many features for bootstrap such as spacing (m-5 or py-3 for example), and responsive utilities (like col-xs, col-md and so on) were learned from: https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap5/bootstrap_utilities.php


Note: the main content within each page was taken from the files of my assignment 1 website portfolio.
