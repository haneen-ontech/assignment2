    <!--container-fluid is a bootstrap class that gives the element a centered and responsive container that takes up the entire width of the page, perfect for fluidity-->
    <!--py-5 means padding y (top and bottom) with a value of 5, this gives the container internal vertical spacing between itself and content for a cleaner look-->

    <!--intro with text -->
    <div class="row justify-content-center mb-5">
    <!--row class for the text, justify-content-center centers the row horizontally, mb-5 gives the row a bottom margin value of 5 to add spacing between itself and the next row-->
      <div class="col-11 col-md-8 col-lg-6 text-center">
        <!--this column was researched for fluidity
        -col-11 is a bootstrap grid class which means on small screens (like phones) the column will take up 11 out of 12 columns (falmost full width)
        -col-md-8 means that on medium screens, the column will take up 8 out of 12 columns (two thirds of the width)
        -col-lg-6 means that on large screens, the column will take up 6 out of 12 columns (half of the width)
        -text-center ensures the element is centered
        -all together this ensures an appealing and fluid look no matter what size screen the home page takes up-->
