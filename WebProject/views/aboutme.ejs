        -col-12 is a bootstrap grid class which means on small screens (like phones) the column will take up all 12 columns (full width)
        -col-md-4 means that on medium screen or larger, the column will take up 4 out of 12 columns (one third of the width)
        -mb-3 means that it has a margin of three at the bottom of the element
        -mb-md-0 means that for medium screens or larger the bottom margin is removed
        -all together this ensures an appealing and fluid look no matter what size screen the about me page takes up-->
